### Introduction
Many developers have been using frameworks to build their web applications. This is because frameworks speed up the development process and are easy to use.

[PHP](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-PHP/) comes with a number of frameworks that can be used to create applications.

Due to the availability of several different frameworks, it may be difficult to choose the right one for your project.

By the end of this tutorial, the developer will be in a position to choose the best framework for their web application.

### Prerequisite
Before starting this tutorial, you should have a basic knowledge of PHP.

### Factors to consider when choosing a framework
Before you make a decision on which PHP framework to use, it is essential to consider the following factors:
1. Popularity Is the framework known and used by many developers? If not, it is not the best choice.
2. Features Is the framework well-suited for the task? If it is, then it is the best choice for your project.
3. Cost. Is the framework affordable? Is it free? If it is, then it is the best choice.
4. View Controller for Models. All PHP frameworks have MVC structures. Therefore, every developer must have a good understanding of the MVC before choosing a framework. 

### Should I use a framework or start coding from scratch?ðŸ˜•
This is a tricky question that may raise a debate among developers. Let's first look at some of the advantages of using a framework before making any judgement.
1. Developers prefer to write less code. the functions and methods of the framework are more accessible than writing the same code from scratch. This means that developers have to write fewer lines of code.
2. Rapid project development framework is like a skeleton; it is already connected. The developer, therefore, needs to add a little bit of code to the framework to make it work.
3. The framework is easy to use. The developer can use the framework without any knowledge of the underlying code.
4. The framework encourages good coding practice. Code is divided into directories and files depending on the functions.
5. Promote teamwork.
