Nowadays, PHP developers have been using PHP web frameworks to build their web applications. This is because frameworks speed up the development process and are easy to use.
<!--more-->
PHP has several frameworks for building web applications. Due to the availability of too many frameworks, choosing the best can be  stressful.

By the end of this article, a developer will be able to choose the best PHP framework for their web application.

### Factors to consider when choosing a PHP framework ü§î
It is essential to consider the following factors when choosing a framework.

1. **Popularity** - Is the framework known and used by many developers? If not, it is may not the best choice.
2. **Features** - Is the framework well-suited for the task? If it is, then it may be a good choice for your project.
3. **Sustainability** - Is the framework well-maintained, will it continue to support your technology stack in the future?
4. **Learning curve** - How long does it take to learn a framework? With good documentation the learning curve flattens and time taken reduces.

### Should I use a framework to develop an application? ü§∑
To answer this question, look at some of the advantages of using a framework.

1. **Rapid project development** -A framework is like a "skeleton"; it is already connected. The developer, therefore, just needs to add a little bit of code to the framework to make it work for their needs.
2. **A framework is easier to use** - The developer can use the framework without any knowledge of the underlying code.
3. **A framework encourages good coding practices** - Code is divided into files annd directories depending on the functionality.
4. **Lesser lines of code** - When using a framework, there is less code to write due to the presence of built-in functions.
5. **Availability of libraries** - A framework has a large library of functions and classes that can be used by the developer.
